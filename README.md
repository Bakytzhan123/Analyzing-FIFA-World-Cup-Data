# Analyzing-FIFA-World-Cup-Data

## Introduction
This project provides an analysys for data set of the FIFA World Cup. As it has a big history and mega huge amount of history I decided to work with this data set. The FIFA World Cup is the premier international soccer competition. The World Cup is held by the governing body of world football - FIFA, and the men's national teams of the FIFA member countries of all continents can participate in it.The final tournaments of the world championships are held every 4 years. Why I have interested on it? 
Main reason for that is by analysing this data set I want to make a prediction to winner of further competition. For that I am planning to consider main factors including the population of the country, the international ranking of the team, the average age of the players, the number of players who have played in the UEFA Champions League, the nationality of the coach and an incredible number of other variables are taken into account.
